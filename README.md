# Proof of Interaction

This Solidity smart contract logs user interactions on-chain by storing their addresses and timestamps.

## Features
- Records user interactions with timestamps
- Publicly accessible `logInteraction` function
- Stores interactions in an array for on-chain tracking

## Smart Contract
### Solidity Code
The contract logs each interaction with the callerâ€™s address and the block timestamp.

## Deployment
1. Deploy the contract on a blockchain network.
2. Copy and paste the deployed contract address below:

**Contract Address:** `0xEAC16B933191e0DfC16A9DD9B49A8212ACAC35E9`

## Usage
- Call the `logInteraction()` function to log an interaction.
- View logged interactions via the `interactions` array.
